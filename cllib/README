  This is a library of modules for the functional programming language
  Objective Caml (http://caml.inria.fr). It provides:


  PC    Parser combinators.  Parsers can be build from primitive parsers
        provided by this module.  Perfect for small parsing issues
        like command line arguments.

  PC2   This is a similar implementation of parser combinators but uses
        different sequence and semantic action operators. 
 
  PP    Pretty printing.  Structured documents are build up from primtive
        ones.  These documents then can be pretty printed for
        different line length to strings or files.  The approach
        follows Philip Wadlers proposed pretty printer algebra. 
        However, it features some small additions and is redesigned
        for strict implementations.

  LC    Lexer combinators for string scanning.  Inspired by the idea of
        parser combinators but especially suited for strings.

  STD   Generic functions which I feel are missing in the OCaml Standard
        library. 
 
  RC    A parser for simple configuration files.    

  RX    Regular Expression matching.
